                <h3>🔥 DevOps Fun Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>DevOps is just a fancy way of saying "everyone is responsible, which means no one is responsible"</li>
                    <li>The "Ops" in DevOps stands for "Oops" - as in what you say after every deployment</li>
                    <li>"You build it, you run it" really means "you build it, you debug it at 3 AM"</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure as Code: because regular code wasn't broken enough</li>
                    <li>The tiara is a mandatory part of the Chef ecosystem - it's in the documentation</li>
                    <li>Every DevOps engineer secretly misses the days when you could just blame the other team</li>
                </ul>
